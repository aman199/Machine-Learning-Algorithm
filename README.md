#Linear Regression.

1) Random dataset is generated using numpy random function with given specification that 1 feature variable and 1 output variable.
2) Biases is added inorder not to overfit the data
3) The weights are calculated using the closed formula. 
4) Test dataset is generated using numpy random function
5) Prediction is done using the trained weights

Future work
1) Use Stochastic Gradient Descent Algorithm so that it can be scaled to huge dataset.
